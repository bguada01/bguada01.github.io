    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I am Italian with East African backgrounds; I was born in Puglia (Apulia), a beautiful region of southern Italy overlooking the sea. Before moving to the UK I lived in Spain, in Barcelona precisely. It was one of the most beautiful life experiences ever. 
    </p>   
    
    <p>I am usually a positive thinking person and I am definitely addicted to travel. I've always been fascinated by art and always find a good excuse to visit exhibitions and art galleries. I speak three languages, but I would like to speak many more. I am actually learning Japanese and planning to move to Osaka very soon. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Although I am not very familiar with technology, I believe in creativity. I am sure that the module will be very stimulating for me and I hope it will help develop new skills. I am glad to be able to take part to DMDD module.
